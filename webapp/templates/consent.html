<h5>Invitation to take part</h5>
You are being invited to take part in this research project.  Before you continue it is important for you to understand why the research is being done and what participation will involve.  Please take time to read the following information carefully and discuss it with others if you wish. Please contact us via prolific if there is anything that is not clear or if you would like more information.  Take time to decide whether or not you wish to take part. Thank you for reading.
<br><br>
<h5>What is the project’s purpose?</h5>
This study is attempting to evaluate the effect different levels of delay has on collaboration online. Anonymous communication online usually involves adding delay to communications, therefore, we wish to find out how much delay can be added to collaboration before communication becomes difficult.

<br><br>
<h5>Why have I been chosen?</h5>
You have been recruited for this survey through prolific. We are attempting to recruit a balanced demographic of users by age and sex, and this may have influenced why you have been recruited.
<br><br>
<h5>Do I have to take part?</h5>
The study is completely voluntary and you should feel free to discontinue the survey at any time without consequence. If you wish to stop the survey at any time, please simply close the website.
<br><br>
<h5>What will happen to me if I take part?</h5>
The study should take approximately 6 minutes to complete. 
You will be answering a series of simple questions in collaboration with another simulated "fake" user. This computer script will be assisting you in answering some of the questions you are asked. The delay that is added may make this more difficult as you and the simulated user may attempt to answer the same question at the same time.
<br><Br>
When you have answered each set of questions you will be asked to grade your experience depending on how frustrating it was, and how well able you were to collaborate with the simulated user. The data we collect from this will then help us to understand how much delay can be added before the experience worsens for users of a collaborative system like this.
<br><br>
<h5>What are the possible disadvantages and risks of taking part?</h5>
As a participant you will face no additional risks, other than the risk typically encountered by using your computer.
<br><br>
<h5>What are the possible benefits of taking part?</h5>
Payment for this survey will be £ 0.75
<br><br>
<h5>What if something goes wrong?</h5>
If you have any complaints or questions about the survey, please contact us through prolific in the first instance, or via the email addresses above. If you do not feel your complain has been properly resolve, you can contact the chair of the UCL ethics committee at ethics@ucl.ac.uk
<br><Br>
<h5>Will my taking part in this project be kept confidential?</h5>
All data collected in this survey will be subject to GDPR protections and will only be released in a form which cannot identify you. None of the data collected can identify you.
<br><br>
<h5>What will happen to the results of the research project?</h5>
The results of this study will be used in our academic work and may be published at a later date. More information about the results will be found here when it is available.  https://killiandavitt.me/collaboration-user-study

The lawful basis that would be used to process any special category data will be scientific or historical research purposes. As this survey does not seek special category data, this lawful basis is only relevant to data which will be deleted by the researchers. I.e. if special category data is entered by participants, it will be deleted before any further processing.
<br><br>
