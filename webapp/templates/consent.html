<h2>Study on collaboration anonymously</h2>
<p>
  This study will evaluate how certain levels of delay affect users ability to collaborate. Methods for communicating anonymously online often add delay to communications, the higher the delay, the more anonymity is achieved. In this study you will be given 3 different tasks and at three different levels of delay. After completing each task you will be asked about your experience. We aim to find the maximum delay added which does not greatly impact your ability to complete the task.
</p>

<p>
In order to properly simulate a collaborative situation, a fake second user will assist you with your tasks. This should help you to complete your task faster.

  </p>

<p>
The data controller for this project will be University College London (UCL). The UCL Data Protection Officer provides oversight of UCL activities involving the processing of personal data, and can be contacted at data-protection@ucl.ac.uk
</p>

<p>
As a result of your participation in this survey, we will receive your demographic data which you have previously provided to Prolific. We will also ask you for your approximate education level. All data collected in this survey will be subject to GDPR protections and will only be released in a form which cannot identify you.
</p>

<p>
The lawful basis that will be used to process your personal data will be performance of a task in the public interest. We do not seek any personal data in this survey, and you should not enter personal data into any of the textboxes.
</p>

<p>
If at any point you enter personal data in this survey, it will be removed by the researchers before any other processing occurs. Additionally, if you disclose your Prolific ID to the researchers through any communications, it will be deleted immediately in order to maintain your anonymity.
</p>

<p>
The lawful basis that would be used to process any special category data will be scientific or historical research purposes. As this survey does not seek special category data, this lawful basis is only relevant to data which will be deleted by the researchers. I.e. if special category data is entered by participants, it will be deleted before any further processing.
</p>

<p>
Unless you enter personal data into the text boxes, we will only receive data from you that is anonymous.
If you are concerned about how your data is being processed, or if you would like to contact us about your rights, please contact UCL in the first instance at data-protection@ucl.ac.uk.

Please See UCL's General privacy notice for more information on UCL's data protection policies <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/legal-services/privacy/ucl-general-research-participant-privacy-notice">https://www.ucl.ac.uk/legal-services/privacy/ucl-general-research-participant-privacy-notice</a>
</p>

<p>
If you wish to revoke your consent for the processing of your data, you can revoke consent through the Prolific platform. Please note that you may only withdraw your consent 7 days after you submit your response, as the data collected will be anonymous, there will be no way to delete you data after the survey closes.
</p>

<p>
If you decide to email the researchers directly, please do not quote your prolific id, as this will deanonymise you. If you include your prolific id in your email to us, we will delete the email without responding in order to keep your data anonymous.
